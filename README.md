# Expanding-NC-Sales-Tax
To offset lowering the state income tax, North Carolina has begun levying sales taxes on services. This project calculates the revenue neutral rate needed to expand the tax base and lower the rate. The project also calculates the sales taxes businesses pass onto consumers (cascading taxes) and the overall tax incidence incurred by North Carolinians.
